# Rainbow-Background

This was made using the linear-gradient function.

This CSS script applies a linear gradient to the body element of your website, starting from red on the left and transitioning through the colors of the rainbow to violet on the right. The linear-gradient function takes two arguments: the direction of the gradient, which is specified using the to keyword followed by a side (right, left, top, or bottom), and a list of colors to use in the gradient.

You can apply this script to your website by adding it to your CSS file or by including it in a style element in the head of your HTML document.

Note that this is just a basic example of how to create a rainbow effect on your website using CSS. You can customize the effect by modifying the colors and direction of the gradient, or by using other CSS properties and techniques to create more complex and interactive effects.
